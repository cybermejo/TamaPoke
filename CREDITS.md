## Sprites and data

| Resource | Source | Use in the project |
|---|---|---|
| **All sprites** (idle, walk, sleep, eat, hurt, attack…) | [PMD Sprite Collaboration (PMDCollab/SpriteCollab)](https://github.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab) | Mystery-Dungeon-style animated sprites used everywhere: main screen, stat card, minigame, and the Pokédex grid + detail view |
| **Gen 1 base stats** | [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) | Real ATK/DEF/SPD/HP for each species |

The **SpriteCollab** sprites are the work of its community of artists under their
own terms (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0). Per-species/per-author
credit is in the original repository's
[tracker.json](https://github.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab/blob/master/tracker.json).
Huge thanks to that whole community for an enormous amount of work.

> **Important if you reuse this repo:** the packaged sprite files
> (`tools/sdcard/mons/*.bin`) are derived from the sources above. Don't
> redistribute them commercially. If you publish the project, the clean approach
> is to distribute **only the code and scripts**, and have each user download and
> package the sprites from the original sources with `tools/pack_*.py` (or the web
> installer).
